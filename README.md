# Make-a-neural-network
In response to Siraj Raval's "How to Make a Neural Network - Intro to Deep Learning #2".

This is a neural network with 3 layers (2 hidden), made using just numpy. It's an adapted version of Siraj's code which had just one layer. The activation function used in this network is the sigmoid function.
